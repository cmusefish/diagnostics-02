Group meeting notes

First, testing to see if we can successfully push a text file to our personal diagnostics folder, and then to the folder of our group within Github

What to detect / measure of interest:
- mean intensity/BOLD value

Outlier detection methods:
- standard deviation: mean +/- (std. dev. * multiplier)
- interquartile range: upper = Q1/Q3 +/- (IQR * multiplier)
- dvars (sum square of variance)
- k-nearest neighbor (learning algorithm can be used for anomaly detection)

Plan
(1) plot mean values for each volume for each subject
- build code to read .nii files in data directory
- calculate mean for each volume across runs
- for each subject, plot mean values of each volume across time/TR

(2) from the code in (1), adapt an outlier method to determine outliers in the
.nii files that we've loaded
