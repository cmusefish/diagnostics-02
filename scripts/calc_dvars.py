""" Script to calculate dvars values

For testing run::

    python3 scripts/calc_dvars.py tests/small_4d.nii

You should see:

    [1.33811116,  1.53370821,  1.40858114]

If you make that work, try running this script over one of your own images.

Next, in IPython, import this module, and use the ``calc_image_dvars`` function
to calculate the DVARS values for one of your images.

Plot the results.

Don't forget the "%matplotlib" in IPython

If you make that work, check that the tests pass by:

* Installing the ``pytest`` module from the terminal with::

    pip install pytest

  Then run the tests with::

   py.test
